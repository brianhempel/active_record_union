# ActiveRecordUnion

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/active_record_union.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/active_record_union)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianhempel/active_record_union.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/brianhempel/active_record_union)

Use unions on ActiveRecord scopes without ugliness.

If you find yourself writing `pluck(:id)` and then feeding that into another query, you may be able to reduce the number of database requests by using a nested query or a UNION without writing crazy JOIN statements.

Quick usage examples:

```ruby
current_user.posts.union(Post.published)
current_user.posts.union(Post.published).where(id: [6, 7])
current_user.posts.union("published_at < ?", Time.now)
user_1.posts.union(user_2.posts).union(Post.published)
user_1.posts.union_all(user_2.posts)
```

ActiveRecordUnion is tested against Rails 4.2 and Rails 5.0. It may or may not work on Rails 4.0/4.1.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_record_union'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_record_union

## Usage

ActiveRecordUnion adds `union` and `union_all` methods to `ActiveRecord::Relation` so we can easily gather together queries on mutiple scopes.

Consider some users with posts:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
end

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user

  scope :published, -> { where("published_at < ?", Time.now) }
end
```

With ActiveRecordUnion, we can do:

```ruby
# the current user's (draft) posts and all published posts from anyone
current_user.posts.union(Post.published)
```

Which is equivalent to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT "posts".* FROM (
  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1
  UNION
  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE (published_at < '2014-07-19 16:04:21.918366')
) "posts"
```

Because the `union` method returns another `ActiveRecord::Relation`, we can run further queries on the union.

```ruby
current_user.posts.union(Post.published).where(id: [6, 7])
```
```sql
SELECT "posts".* FROM (
  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1
  UNION
  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE (published_at < '2014-07-19 16:06:04.460771')
) "posts"  WHERE "posts"."id" IN (6, 7)
```

The `union` method can also accept anything that `where` does.

```ruby
current_user.posts.union("published_at < ?", Time.now)
# equivalent to...
current_user.posts.union(Post.where("published_at < ?", Time.now))
```

We can also chain `union` calls to UNION more than two scopes, though the UNIONs will be nested which may not be the prettiest SQL.

```ruby
user_1.posts.union(user_2.posts).union(Post.published)
# equivalent to...
[user_1.posts, user_2.posts, Post.published].inject(:union)
```
```sql
SELECT "posts".* FROM (
  SELECT "posts".* FROM (
    SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1
    UNION
    SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 2
  ) "posts"
  UNION
  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE (published_at < '2014-07-19 16:12:45.882648')
) "posts"
```

### UNION ALL

By default, UNION will remove any duplicates from the result set. If you don't care about duplicates or you know that the two queries you are combining will not have duplicates, you call use UNION ALL to tell the database to skip its deduplication step. In some cases this can give significant performance improvements.

```ruby
user_1.posts.union_all(user_2.posts)
```
```sql
SELECT "posts".* FROM (
  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 2
) "posts"
```

## Caveats

There's a couple things to be aware of when using ActiveRecordUnion:

1. ActiveRecordUnion will raise an error if you try to UNION any relations that do any preloading/eager-loading. There's no sensible way to do the preloading in the subselects. If enough people complain, maybe, we can change ActiveRecordUnion to let the queries run anyway but without preloading any records.
2. There's no easy way to get SQLite to allow ORDER BY in the UNION subselects. If you get a syntax error, you can either write `my_relation.reorder(nil).union(other.reorder(nil))` or switch to Postgres.

## Another nifty way to reduce extra queries

ActiveRecord already supports turning scopes into nested queries in WHERE clauses. The nested relation defaults to selecting `id` by default.

For example, if a user `has_and_belongs_to_many :favorited_posts`, we can quickly find which of the current user's posts are liked by a certain other user.

```ruby
current_user.posts.where(id: other_user.favorited_posts)
```
```sql
SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"
  WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1
  AND "posts"."id" IN (
    SELECT "posts"."id"
      FROM "posts" INNER JOIN "user_favorited_posts" ON "posts"."id" = "user_favorited_posts"."post_id"
      WHERE "user_favorited_posts"."user_id" = 2
  )
```

If we want to select something other than `id`, we use `select` to specify. The following is equivalent to the above, but the query is done against the join table.

```ruby
current_user.posts.where(id: UserFavoritedPost.where(user_id: other_user.id).select(:post_id))
```
```sql
SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"
  WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1
  AND "posts"."id" IN (
    SELECT "user_favorited_posts"."post_id"
      FROM "user_favorited_posts"
      WHERE "user_favorited_posts"."user_id" = 2
  )
```

(The above example is illustrative only. It might be better with a JOIN.)

## State of the Union in ActiveRecord

Why does this gem exist?

Right now in ActiveRecord, if we call `scope.union` we get an `Arel::Nodes::Union` object instead of an `ActiveRecord::Relation`.

We could call `to_sql` on the Arel object and then use `find_by_sql`, but that's not super clean. Also, on Rails 4.0 and 4.1 if the original scopes included an association then the `to_sql` may produce a query with values that need to be bound (represented by `?`s in the SQL) and we have to provide those ourselves. (E.g. `user.posts.to_sql` produces `SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts"  WHERE "posts"."user_id" = ?`.) Rails 4.2's `to_sql` replaces the bind values before showing the SQL string and thus can more readily be used with `find_by_sql`. (E.g. Rails 4.2 `to_sql` would say `WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1` instead of `WHERE "posts"."user_id" = ?`.)

While ActiveRecord may eventually have the ability to cleanly perform UNIONs, it's currently stalled. If you're interested, the relevant URLs as of July 2014 are:

https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/939 and
https://github.com/rails/arel/pull/239 and
https://github.com/yakaz/rails/commit/29b8ebd187e0888d5e71b2e1e4a12334860bc76c

This is a gem not a Rails pull request because the standard of code quality for a PR is a bit higher, and we'd have to wait for the PR to be merged and relased to use UNIONs. That said, the code here is fairly clean and it may end up in a PR sometime.
